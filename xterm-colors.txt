OK Xterm is just painful at times

but...

it runs off a terminfo database (used to be called termcap)
We see where it is stored as ::

 [11:21][pbrian@hadrian:~]$ env | grep -i term
 TERM=rxvt
 TERMINFO=/usr/local/share/misc/terminfo.db
 COLORTERM=rxvt-xpm

 [11:24][pbrian@hadrian:~]$ file $TERMINFO
 /usr/local/share/misc/terminfo.db: Berkeley DB 1.85 (Hash, version 2, native byte-order)


we create it by ::

 sudo xrdb .Xresources 

Actually that might not be true

but we defintelyt need to look after colors in emacs / terminal

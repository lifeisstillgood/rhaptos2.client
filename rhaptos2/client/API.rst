We have two clients, a http only client (based on requests library)
and a browser based client based on splinter.

THe splinter requires X so it is - well, not tested a lot. But We
should split it onto a seperate Jenkins slave somehow.  Maybe a
windows server?


>>> from rhaptos2.client import restclient

#logon
